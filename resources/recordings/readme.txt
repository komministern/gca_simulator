You can record the data stream from the flight simulator, and replay at some later time.
This is done in the STATUS window in the simulation. The recorded data is placed in a file
named newrecording.rcd in this directory. You then have to change the name of this file if 
you want to keep it, as the next recording also will be named newrecording.rcd and thus 
will overwrite the previous one. The demo.rcd is a pre-recorded demonstration of the 
feature, and should never be removed.

demo.rcd:
Start the demo.rcd from the STATUS window at the same time as you start the demo.mp4 in the 
video directory in your favourite media player. This will visually demonstrate landings of 
two SAAB AJS37 Viggen and a C-130 in reasonable sync with each other. If you set your media 
player on repeat, the sync will prevail for a fair bit of time, as the demo in the simulator 
also repeats itself. One cycle is exactly 10 minutes and 8 seconds.
