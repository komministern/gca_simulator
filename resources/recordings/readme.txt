You can record the data stream from the flight simulator, and replay at some later time.
This is done in the STATUS window in the simulation. The recorded data is placed in a file
named newrecording.rcd in this directory. You then have to change the name of this file if 
you want to keep it, as the next recording also will be named newrecording.rcd and thus 
will overwrite the previous one. The demo.rcd is a pre-recorded demonstration of the 
feature, and should never be removed.
