This video was created with DCS and OBS Studio. Start the demo mode with the
file demo.rcd at the same time as you start the video file demo.mp4 in your
favourite media player. This will show some aircrafts as they land on the
Batumi airport, all in sync with the gca simulator demo. 
The demo will restart when there is no recorded data left in the record file, 
and if you activate the repeat option in media the player, the demo and the video
should stay in sync for some time. (A complete demo loop is exactly 10 minutes
and 8 seconds long, the same length as the video.)
